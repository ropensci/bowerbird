#' Example bowerbird data sources
#'
#' These example sources are useful as data sources in their own right, but are primarily provided as demonstrations of how to define data sources. See also \code{vignette("bowerbird")} for further examples and discussion.
#'
#' Example data sources:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item "NOAA OI SST V2" - a straightforward data source that requires a simple one-level recursive download
#'   \item "Australian Election 2016 House of Representatives data" - an example of a recursive download that uses additional criteria to restrict what is downloaded
#'   \item "CMEMS global gridded SSH reprocessed (1993-ongoing)" - a data source that requires a username and password
#'   \item "Oceandata SeaWiFS Level-3 mapped monthly 9km chl-a" - an example data source that uses the \code{bb_handler_oceandata} method
#'   \item "Sea Ice Trends and Climatologies from SMMR and SSM/I-SSMIS, Version 3" - an example data source that uses the \code{bb_handler_earthdata} method
#'   \item "Bathymetry of Lake Superior" - another example that passes extra flags to the \code{bb_handler_rget} call in order to restrict what is downloaded
#' }
#'
#' @param sources character: names or identifiers of one or more sources to return. See Details for the list of example sources and a brief explanation of each
#' @references See the \code{doc_url} and \code{citation} field in each row of the returned tibble for references associated with these particular data sources
