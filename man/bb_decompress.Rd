\title{Postprocessing: decompress zip, gz, bz2, tar, Z files and optionally delete the compressed copy}
\usage{
bb_decompress(method, delete = FALSE, ...)

bb_unzip(...)

bb_gunzip(...)

bb_bunzip2(...)

bb_uncompress(...)

bb_inflate(...)

bb_untar(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{string: one of "unzip", "gunzip", "bunzip2", "decompress", "untar"}

\item{delete}{logical: delete the zip files after extracting their contents?}

\item{...}{: extra parameters passed automatically by \code{bb_sync}}
}
\value{
list with components status (\code{TRUE} on success), \code{files} (character vector of paths to extracted files), and \code{deleted_files} (character vector of paths of files that were deleted)
}
\description{
Functions for decompressing files after downloading. These functions are not intended to be called directly, but rather are specified as a \code{postprocess} option in \code{\link{bb_source}}. \code{bb_unzip}, \code{bb_untar}, \code{bb_gunzip}, \code{bb_bunzip2}, and \code{bb_uncompress} are convenience wrappers around \code{bb_decompress} that specify the method.
}
\details{
Tar files can be compressed (i.e. file extensions .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .tar.xz). Support for tar files may depend on your platform (see \code{\link{untar}}).

If the data source delivers compressed files, you will most likely want to decompress them after downloading. These functions will do this for you. By default, these do not delete the compressed files after decompressing. The reason for this is so that on the next synchronization run, the local (compressed) copy can be compared to the remote compressed copy, and the download can be skipped if nothing has changed. Deleting local compressed files will save space on your file system, but may result in every file being re-downloaded on every synchronization run.

\dontrun{
  ## decompress .zip files after synchronization but keep zip files intact
  my_source <- bb_source(..., postprocess = list("bb_unzip"))

  ## decompress .zip files after synchronization and delete zip files
  my_source <- bb_source(..., postprocess = list(list("bb_unzip", delete = TRUE)))
